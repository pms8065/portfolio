                        This is a website where you can get an idea of ​​
                        what you look like on the outside by comparing 
                        what you think you are and what your friends think of
                        you. There are tons of personality test websites out 
                        there, but none of this type has ever existed, 
                        and I did this because it was a fairly light project 
                        where I could learn how to work with backend developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a project where I learned a lot about 
                        the process of collaborating with back-end 
                        developers. We communicated by writing UI & UX 
                        and API specifications as documents. In addition,
                        we were able to learn a lot from each other about
                        concepts such as cookies and CORS, which are 
                        necessary in the communication process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a project that put a lot of effort into 
                        designing by utilizing various animation effects 
                        and canvas API. Also, I was able to think a lot 
                        about UI & UX by designing my own design without 
                        a designer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was a project that helped me to better 
                        understand the concepts of routing, CSR, SSR, and
                        SG while creating a multi-page Next.js website.
